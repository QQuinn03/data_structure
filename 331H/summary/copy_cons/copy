When is copy constructor called?
In C++, a Copy Constructor may be called in following cases:
1. When an object of the class is returned by value.
  rectangle makerectangle()
  {
     rectangle object(12,3);
     return object;
  }
2. When an object of the class is passed (to a function) by value as an argument.
 void fun(NumberArray2 object)
3. When an object is being created based on another object of the same class.
4. When the compiler generates a temporary object.

Copy constructors are not called when a parameter of the class
is passed by reference or through a pointer, nor are they called
when a function returns a reference or pointer to
an object of the class.
