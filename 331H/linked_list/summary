example structure of a linked list
a node had two fields, one stores actual data,
one pointer point to the next node

struct node
{
   <x> value;  // at least one variable for data section
   node * next   // the pointer pointes to the next node
}

void inserting value(<> value)
{
  node *temp = new node;
  if(head == nullptr) { temp->value = value; head = temp;}
  else
  {
     temp->value = value;
     temp->next = head;
     head = temp;
  }

}

when you assign a pointer to another pointer, eg
temp = head;  you are assiging head's address to temp
now temp has the same address as head;
